Portfolio
=========
This is the Portfolio project for the CodeFellows Ruby on Rails bootcamp.  This portfolio
is a showcase of my work and my capabilities.  This portfolios will grow as I implement
what I learn.  See other projects in my repository to see examples that don't fit in well
in the context of my professional portfolio.

QUESTION: Add additional spec that is modification of home page spec, but checks instead against your public domain name.  I had trouble with this.  I could see how to set up
(free trial or paid) accounts on pingdom.com (to automate pinging of your site) and
pingtest.net to ping the machine you are on right now.  But not how to set up my own
test for this.
